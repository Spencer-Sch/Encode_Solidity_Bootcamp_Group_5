# Week 1 weekend homework - HelloWorld.sol

### What we did
- Using Remix, We deployed the HelloWorld.sol contract
  - We deployed to Polygon Mumbai testnet becuase Sepolia was being very slow
  - Contract Address: 0xeB48ed9fdc00F0E2C7EeB13eA4acBb94A0dA573c
  - Contract on Polyscan: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xeB48ed9fdc00F0E2C7EeB13eA4acBb94A0dA573c
- Each member of the team connected their MetaMask to the Mumbai testnet
- Each member funded their wallet with some test Matic (for paying gas fees) by either visiting the Mumbai faucet or sending between members
- Each member of the team connected their Remix IDE to the contract via the "at address" field.
- Each member of the team completed the following actions:
  - send a call to the "setText" function
  - record the transaction hash
  - send a call to the "transferOwnership" function
