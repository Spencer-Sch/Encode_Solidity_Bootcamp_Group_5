- Steps:

    - List each script that will need to be written
    - Sudo code these scripts
    - Assign members to write scripts

- Final Homework Goal:

        - Member with "MINTER_ROLE" will mint and send tokens to other members.
        - Each member will need to self delegate

        - some members vote
        - some members transfer tokens to other members
